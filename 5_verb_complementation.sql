INSERT INTO RULE(id_rule, name, detail, pack) VALUES (29, 'Unit 29: Verb + two objects', 'Some verbs are followed by two objects. Usually the first object is a person (or group of people)
and the second object is a thing:
- Can you bring me (= object 1) some milk (= object 2) from the shops?
- I made him (= object 1) a cup of coffee. (= object 2)
With many verbs that can have two objects, we can reverse the order of the objects if we put for
or to before object 1 (this is then called a prepositional object). Compare:
- They built us a new house. 	and - They built a new house for us.
- Can you give me that bandage? and - Can you give that bandage to me?
We often use this pattern if we want to focus particular attention on the object after for/to. We
also use it if object 1 is a lot longer than object 2:
- Jasmin taught music to a large number of children at the school, {not Jasmin taught a large
number of children at the school music.)
- Judith booked theatre tickets for all the students who were doing her Shakespeare course.
(not Judith booked all the students who were doing her Shakespeare course theatre tickets.)
We use for + object with verbs such as book, build, buy, catch, choose, cook, fetch, find, make,
order, pour, save. We use to + object with verbs such as award, give, hand, lend, offer, owe,
pass, show, teach, tell, throw.
play, post,
g:
fir
In With some other verbs we can use either to or for, including bring, leave, pay,
read, send, sing, take, write. Sometimes there is very little difference in meanin
- He played the piece of music to (or for) me.
- Can you sing that song again to (or for) us.
Often, however, there is a difference. Compare:
- I took some apples to my sister.
- Ann didn''t have time to take her library books back, so I took them for her.
A few other verbs that are followed by two objects cannot have their objects reversed with for/to:
- We all envied him his lifestyle, (but not We all envied his lifestyle for/to him.)
Other verbs like this include allow, ask, cost, deny, forgive, guarantee, permit, refuse.
Some verbs can only have a second object if this is a prepositional object with to:
- They explained the procedure. /
- They explained me the procedure. X
- They explained the procedure to me. /
- The suspect confessed his crime. /
- The suspect confessed the police his crime. X 
- The suspect confessed his crime to the police. /
Other verbs like this include admit, announce, demonstrate, describe, introduce, mention,
-point out, prove, report, say, suggest.
The verbs collect, mend and raise can only have a second object if this is a prepositional object
with for:
- He raised a lot of money for charity, (not He raised charity a lot of money.)', 5);

INSERT INTO RULE(id_rule, name, detail, pack) VALUES (31, 'Unit 31: Verb + -ing', 'Some verbs must have an object before an -ing form:
- The police found the man climbing the wall.
- She overheard them talking about the
closure of the factory.
Other verbs like this include catch, discover, feel, hear, leave, notice, observe, see, spot, watch

Notice, however, that this is not the case when these verbs are in the passive:
- The man was found climbing the wall.

Some verbs can have an object or no object before an -ing form:
- They can''t stand (him) driving his old car.
- I remember (you) buying that jumper.
Other verbs like this include detest, dislike, dread, envisage, hate, imagine, like, love, mind 
(in questions and negatives), miss, recall, regret, resent, risk, start, stop 

Some verbs can''t have an object before an -ing form:
- Despite his injury he continued playing.
- I actually enjoy cleaning shoes. It''s relaxing!
Other verbs like this include admit, advise, consider, delay, deny, deserve, escape, face,
finish, forget, propose, put off, suggest

Some of the verbs in ะ and ะก (admit, deny, forget, recall, regret, remember) can be followed by
having + past participle instead of the -ing form, with little difference in meaning:
- He remembered having arrived at the party, but not leaving, (or He remembered arriving...)
- I now regret having bought the car. (or I now regret buying...)
These pairs of sentences have the same meaning:
- I resented Tom winning the prize. 	and - I resented Tom''s winning the prize.
- Mary recalled him borrowing the book, and - Mary recalled his borrowing the book.
Other verbs that can be followed by an object with a possessive and then an -ing form include
verbs of ''(dis)liking'' such as detest, disapprove of, dislike, hate, like, love, object to, and verbs of
''thinking'' such as envisage, forget, imagine, remember, think of. Notice that we can only use a
possessive form (Tom''s, his) like this to talk about a person or a group of people:
- I remembered the horse winning the race, (but not ...the horse''s winning...)
The possessive form in this pattern is usually considered to be rather formal.
A few verbs (feel, hear, notice, observe, overhear, see, watch) can be followed either by an -ing
form or a bare infinitive, but the meaning may be slightly different:
an -ing form
	suggests that the action is repeated or happens over a period of time.
	 # Did you hear those dogs barking most of the night?
	suggests that we watch, etc. some of the action, but not from start to finish 
 I 	 was able to watch them building the new car park from my office window.
a bare infinitive
	suggests that the action happens only once 
	 I noticed him throw a sweet wrapper on the floor, so I asked him to pick it up.
	suggests that we watch, hear, etc. the whole action from its start to its finish
	 I watched him climb through the window, and then I called the police.', 5);
