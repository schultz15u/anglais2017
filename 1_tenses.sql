'We use the present simple to describe things that are always true, or situations that exist now and,
as far as we know, will go on indefinitely:
- It takes me five minutes to get to school.
- Trees grow more quickly in summer than in winter. - Liz plays the violin brilliantly.
To talk about particular actions or events that have begun but have not ended at the time of
speaking, we use the present continuous:
- The car isn''t starting again.
- ''Who are you phoning?'' ''I''m trying to get through to Joan.''
- The shop is so inefficient that many customers are taking their business elsewhere.
We often use time expressions such as at the moment, at present, currently, just, and still to
emphasise that the action or event is happening now:
- ''Have you done the shopping?'' Tm just going.''
Notice that the action or event may not be going on at the time of speaking:
- The police are talking to a number of people about the robbery.
We use the present simple to talk about habits or things that happen on a regular basis:
- I leave work at 5.30 most days.
- Each July we go to Turkey for a holiday.
However, when we describe repeated actions or events that are happening at or around the time
of speaking, we use the present continuous:
- Why are you jumping up and down?
- I''m hearing a lot of good reports about your work these days.
We can use the present continuous or the present simple to describe something that we regularly
do at a particular time. Compare:
- We usually watch the news on TV at 9.00. (= we start watching at 9.00)
- We''re usually watching the news on TV at 9.00. (= we''re already watching at 9.00)
We use the present continuous to imply that a situation is or may be temporary. Compare:
- Banks lend money to make a profit, (this is what usually happens)
- Banks are lending more money (these days) to encourage businesses to expand, (implies a
temporary arrangement)
- She teaches Maths in a school in Bonn, (a permanent arrangement)
- She''s teaching Maths in a school in Bonn, (implies that this is not, or may not be, permanent)
We often use the present simple with verbs that perform the action they describe:
- I admit I can''t see as well as I used to. (= an admission)
- I refuse to believe that he didn''t know the car was stolen. (= a refusal)
Other verbs like this (sometimes called performative verbs) include accept, acknowledge, advise,
apologise, assume, deny, guarantee, hope, inform, predict, promise, recommend, suggest,
suppose, warn.
We can use modals with performative verbs to make what we say more tentative or polite:.
- I would advise you to arrive two hours before the flight leaves.
- I''m afraid I have to inform you that your application for funding has been turned down.', 1);

INSERT INTO RULE(id_rule, name, detail, pack) VALUES (2, 'Unit 2: Present continuous and present simple 2', 'We often prefer to use the present simple rather than the present continuous with verbs describing
states:
- I really enjoy travelling.
- The group currently consists of five people, but we hope to get more members soon.
Ð“ Other common state verbs include agree, assume, believe, belong to, contain, cost, disagree, feel,
hate, have, hope, know, like, look, love, own, prefer, realise, regret, resemble, smell, taste.
However, we can use the present continuous with some state verbs when we want to emphasise
that a situation is temporary, for a period of time around the present. Compare:
- I consider him to be extremely fortunate. (This is my view) and
- I''m considering taking early retirement. (This is something I''m thinking about now)
- The children love having Jean stay with us. (They love it when Jean stays) and
- The children are loving having Jean stay with us. (Jean is staying with us now)
With some verbs used to describe a temporary state (e.g. ache, feel, hurt, look (= seem)), there is
little difference in meaning when we use the present simple and present continuous:
- What''s the matter with Bill? He looks / is looking awful.
When have has a non-state meaning - for example when it means ''eat'', ''undergo'', ''take'' or
''hold'' - we can use the present continuous:
- ''What''s that terrible noise?'' ''The neighbours are having a party.''
eWe use the present continuous when we talk about changes, developments, and trends:
- - The growing number of visitors is damaging the footpaths.
- I''m beginning to realise how difficult it is to be a teacher.
When we tell a story or joke we often describe the main events using the present (or past) simple
and longer, background events using the present (or past) continuous:
- She goes (or went) up to this man and looks (or looked) straight into his eyes. She''s carrying
(or was carrying) a bag full of shopping...
We can also use the present simple and present continuous like this in
commentaries (for example, on sports events) and in giving instructions:
- King serves to the left hand court and Adams makes a wonderful
return. She''s playing magnificent tennis in this match...
- You hold the can in one hand. Right, you''re holding it in one hand,
now you take off the lid with the other.
When we want to emphasise that something is done repeatedly, we can use the present continuous
with words like always, constantly, continually, or forever. Often we do this when we want to
show that we are unhappy about it, including our own behaviour:
- They''re constantly having parties until the early hours of the morning.
We use the past continuous (see Unit 6) in the same way:
- He was forever including me in his crazy schemes.
The present simple is used to report what we have heard or what we have read:
- This newspaper article explains why unemployment has been rising so quickly.
We also use the present simple in spoken English in phrases such as I gather, I hear, I see, and I
understand to introduce news that we have heard, read or seen (e.g. on television):
- I gather you''re worried about the new job?
- The Prince is coming to visit, and I hear he''s very rich.', 1);

INSERT INTO RULE(id_rule, name, detail, pack) VALUES (3, 'Unit 3: Past simple and present perfect', 'Present perfect
When we talk about something that happened in the past, but we don''t specify precisely when it
happened (perhaps we don''t know, or it is not important to say when it happened), we use the
present perfect (but see E below):
- A French yachtsman has broken the record for sailing round the world single-handed.
- I have complained about the traffic before.
When we use the present perfect, it suggests some kind of connection between what happened in
the past, and the present time. Often we are interested in the way that something that happened in
the past affects the situation that exists now:
- I''ve washed my hands so that I can help you with the cooking.
- We can''t go ahead with the meeting, because very few people have shown any interest.
The connection with the present may also be that something happened recently, with a
consequence for the present:
- I''ve found the letter you were looking for. Here it is.
- My ceiling has fallen in and the kitchen is flooded. Come quickly!
When we talk about how long an existing situation has lasted, even if we don''t give a precise
length of time, we use the present perfect (but see F below):
- They''ve grown such a lot since we last saw them.
- Prices have fallen sharply over the past six months.
- We''ve recently started to walk to work instead of taking the bus.
We often use the present perfect to say that an action or event has been repeated a number of
times up to now (see also Unit 4B):
- They''ve been to Chile three times. - I''ve often wished I''d learned to read music.
Past simple
When we want to indicate that something happened at a specific time in the past, we use the past
simple. We can either say when it happened, using a time adverb, or assume that the hearer
already knows when it happened or can understand this from the context:
- She arrived at Kennedy Airport at 2 o''clock this morning.
- Jane left just a few minutes ago.
- Jim decided to continue the course, even though it was proving very difficult.
We use the past simple for situations that existed for a period of time in the past, but not now:
- When I was younger I played badminton for my local team.
- The Pharaohs ruled Egypt for thousands of years.
If we are interested in when a present situation began rather than how long it has been going on
for, we use the past simple. Compare:
- I started to get the pains three weeks ago. - I''ve had the pains for three weeks now.
a - When did you arrive in Britain? - How long have you been in Britain?
-However, we also use the past simple to talk about how long something went on for if the action
or event is no longer going on (see also Unit 4C):
- I stayed with my grandparents for six months. (= I am no longer staying there)
- ''He spent some time in Paris when he was younger.'' ''How long did he live there?''', 1);

the past continuous:

- My head was aching again, so I went home.
Compare the use of the past continuous and the past simple in these sentences:
- She was shaking with anger as she left the hotel.
- When he realised I was looking at him, he turned away.
- Erika dropped her bag while she was getting into her car.
We often use the past simple to talk about a completed past event and the past continuous to
describe the situation that existed at the time. The completed event might have interrupted the
situation, or just occurred while the situation or event was in progress.
We don''t normally use the past continuous with certain verbs describing states (see Unit 2A):
- This house belonged to the King of Sweden, (not ...was belonging to...)
D When we talk about two past actions or events that went on over
the same period of time, we can often use the past continuous for both:
- Sally was reading to the children while Kevin was washing up.
- Mario was working in a restaurant when I was living in London.
However, we can often use the past simple to express a similar meaning:
- Mario worked in a restaurant while he lived in London, (or ...was living in London.)
When we talk about two or more past completed events that follow each other, we use the past
simple for both. The first may have caused the second:
- She got up when the alarm clock went off.
- He jumped out of bed and ran to see who the parcel was for.
When we talk about a permanent or long-term situation that existed in the past, we use the past
simple rather than the past continuous:
- When I was a child I played the violin, (not ...I was playing...)
However, if the situation was temporary, we can also use the past continuous. Compare:
- I was working in a car factory during the summer of 1976. (or I worked...) and
- He worked hard all his life, (not He was working...)
We use the past simple rather than the past continuous when we are talking about repeated
actions or events in the past:
- We visited Spain three times last year, (not We were visiting...)
- I went past her house every day. (not I was going...)
- She slept very badly whenever she stayed with her grandparents, (not ...was sleeping...)
However, the past continuous can also be used when we want to emphasise that the repeated
actions only went on for a limited and temporary period of past time (See also Unit 2C):
- When Carlo was in hospital, we were visiting him twice a day. (or ...we visited...)
- To get fit for the race, I was going to the sports centre every day. (or ...I went...)
We use the past continuous when the repeated actions or events provide a longer background to
something else that happened (see A):
- During the time I started to get chest pains, I was playing tennis a lot.', 1);

past situation or activity, or before a particular time in the past:
- Jo discovered that Leslie had lied to her.
- As Mary shook Mr Morgan''s hand, she realised she had seen him before.

We use the past simple rather than the past perfect when we simply talk about a single activity or
Â«event in the past:
- - I handed the letter to him. - Sorry we''re late, we took the wrong turning.
Notice the difference in meaning of these sentences with the past perfect and past simple:
- When he stopped laughing, everyone left. (= they left after he stopped laughing)
- When he stopped laughing, everyone had left. (= they left before he stopped laughing)
- I got up when the phone rang. (= the phone rang and then I got up)
- I had gone to bed when the phone rang. (= I went to bed and then the phone rang)

When we give an account of a sequence of past events, we usually put these events in chronological
order with the past simple. If we want to refer to an event out of order - that is, it happened
before the last event we have talked about - we use the present perfect.

We use the past perfect when we say what we wanted or hoped (etc.) to do, but didn''t:
- I had wanted to visit the gallery before I left Florence, but it''s closed on Sundays.
- Bill had hoped to retire at 60, but they persuaded him to stay on for a few more years.
Other verbs used like this include expect (to), mean (to), think (about + -ing).
When we use a time expression (e.g. after, as soon as, before, by the time (that), when) to say that
one event happened after another, we use either the past simple or past perfect for the event that
happened first and the past simple for the event that happened second:
- After Ivan (had) finished reading, he put out the light.
- When Carol (had) brushed her teeth, she went to bed.
But to emphasise that the second event is the result of the first, we prefer the past simple for both:
- She became famous after she appeared on the TV programme.
- When the teacher came in, all the children stood up.
With already and just (= a very short time before) we use the past perfect, not the past simple:
- The film had already begun by the time we got to the cinema.
