INSERT INTO RULE(id_rule, name, detail, pack) VALUES (21, 'Unit 21: Linking verbs: be, appear, seem, become, get, etc.', 'In the following sentences we use an adjective or noun after a verb to describe the subject or say
what or who the subject is:
- Ian is a doctor. - She seemed unable to concentrate.
- The house became Peter''s in 1980.
The adjective or noun in sentences like this is called a complement, the verb is called a linking
verb. The most common linking verb is be, others include become, come, grow, turn, keep,
remain, stay, appear, look, seem, sound.
appear, seem
After appear (= seems true) and seem we sometimes use to be before an adjective:
- He seems/appears (to be) very nervous.
We include to be before the adjectives alive, alone, asleep, and awake:
- I didn''t go in because she appeared to be asleep, (not ...appeared asleep.)
Before a noun we include to be when the noun tells us who or what the subject is, but can often
leave it out when we give our opinion of the person or thing in the subject. We leave out to be in
more formal English. Compare:
- He went through what appeared to be a locked door, (not ...appeared a locked door.)
- She seems (to be) a very efficient salesperson.
nNotice that we include to be before -ing forms (growing, moving, etc.):
- - It seems to be growing rapidly.
become, come, get, go, grow, turn (into)
We use the linking verb become to describe a process of change. A number of other linking verbs
can be used instead of become, including come, get, go, grow, turn (into).
We use get rather than become in informal speech and writing, in imperatives, and in phrases
such as get broken, get dressed, get killed, get lost, get married, get washed:
- Don''t get upset about it! - Where did you live before you got married}
We prefer become when we talk about a more abstract or technical process of change:
- He became recognised as the leading authority on the subject.
- Their bodies have become adapted to living at high altitudes.
We use become, not get, if there is a noun after the linking verb describing a change of job:
- Dr Smallman became an adviser to the US government.
We use go or turn, not get, when we talk about colours changing:
- The traffic lights turned/went green and I pulled away.
We often use go when we talk about changing to an undesirable state. For example, we use go,
not turn or get, when we say that somebody becomes deaf, blind, bald, or starts to behave in a
mad or excited way, and also in phrases such as go bad/off/mouldy (food), go dead (a telephone),
go missing, and go wrong.
- The children went completely crazy at the party. - My computer''s gone wrong again.
We use turn to say that somebody reaches a particular age, and turn into when we say that one
material or thing becomes another:
- He turned sixty last year. - In my dream all the sheep turned into wolves.
After the verbs come, get, and grow we can use a to-infinitive. Come and grow are often used to
talk about gradual change. We can''t use a to-infinitive after become:
- I eventually came/grew to appreciate his work, (not ...became to appreciate...)
- I soon got to know their names, (not ...became to know...)', 4);

INSERT INTO RULE(id_rule, name, detail, pack) VALUES (23, 'Unit 23: Forming passive sentences : verb + -ing or to-infinitive', 'Passive verb forms have one of the tenses of the verb to be and a past participle. Passive verb
forms are summarised in Appendix 1.
Verbs which take an object (transitive verbs) can have a passive form. So we can make
corresponding passive sentences for:
- They destroyed the building. «—- The building was destroyed.
- The news surprised me. «—- I was surprised by the news.
Verbs which do not take an object (intransitive verbs) do not have passive forms. For example,
there are no passive forms for the following sentences:
- I slept for nearly ten hours last night.
- The ship slowly disappeared from view.
A good dictionary will tell you whether verbs are transitive or intransitive.
However, many verbs can be used at different times with and without objects - that is, they can
be both transitive and intransitive. Compare:
- Are they meeting him at the station? (transitive) Is he being met at the airport? (passive)
- When shall we meet? (intransitive, no passive possible)
В Verbs that can be followed by either object + object or object + prepositional object in active
clauses (see Unit 42) can have two corresponding passive forms. The passive form you choose
depends on which is more appropriate in a particular context. Compare:

active
- She handed me the plate. /
- She handed the plate to me. /

passive
- I was handed the plate. /
- The plate was handed to me. /

Other verbs like this include give, lend, offer, promise, sell, teach, tell, throw. However,
verbs that can''t be followed by object + object in the active have only one of these
passive forms:

- He described me the situation. X
- He described the situation to me. /
- I was described the situation. X
- The situation was described to me. /

Other verbs like this include demonstrate, explain, introduce, mention, report, suggest.
We can make a passive form of transitive two- and three-word verbs (see Unit 114). Compare:
- Martha talked me into buying a motorbike. (= V + object + preposition) and
- I was talked into buying a motorbike by Martha.
- They gave over the whole programme to a report from Bosnia. (= V + adverb + object +
preposition) and
- The whole programme was given over to a report from Bosnia.
Some transitive two- and three-word verbs are rarely used in the passive:
- We got the money back for her, but it took ages, (rather than The money was got back...)
- I had to put out a hand to steady myself, (rather than A hand was put out...)
Other verbs like this include get down (= write what somebody says), let in (= when something
has a hole in it that allows water, light, etc. to get into it), let out (e.g. a scream), show off (=
encourage people to see something because you are proud of it), take after (= resemble).', 4);

INSERT INTO RULE(id_rule, name, detail, pack) VALUES (24, 'Unit 24: Using passives', 'The choice between an active and passive sentence allows us to present the same information in
two different orders. Compare:
active - The storm damaged the roof.
This sentence is about the storm, and
says what it did. [The storm is the
''agent''.)

passive - The roof was damaged by the storm.
This sentence is about the roof, and says what
happened to it. (The ''agent'' goes in a
prepositional phrase with by after the verb.)

Here are some situations where we typically choose a passive rather than an active.
- When the agent is not known, is ''people in general'', is unimportant, or is obvious, we prefer
passives. In an active sentence we need to include the agent as subject, using a passive allows us
to omit the agent by leaving out the prepositional phrase with by:
- My office was broken into when I was on holiday, (unknown agent)
- An order form can be found on page 2. (agent = people in general)
- These boxes should be handled with care, (unimportant agent)
- She is being treated in hospital, (obvious agent, presumably ''doctors'')
- In factual writing, particularly in describing procedures or processes, we often wish to omit the
agent, and use passives:
- Nuclear waste will still be radioactive even after 20,000 years, so it must be disposed of
very carefully. It can be stored as a liquid in stainless-steel containers which are encased in
concrete. The most dangerous nuclear waste can be turned into glass. It is planned to store
this glass in deep underground mines.
- In spoken English we often use a subject such as people, somebody, they, we, or you even when
we do not know who the agent is. In formal English, particularly writing, we often prefer to
use a passive. Compare:
- They''re installing the new computer system next month.
- The new computer system is being installed next month, (more formal)
Notice also that some verbs have corresponding nouns. These nouns can be used as the subject
of passive sentences, with a new passive verb introduced:
- The installation of the new computer system will be completed by next month.
- In English we usually prefer to put old information at the beginning of a sentence (or clause)
and new information at the end. Choosing the passive often allows us to do this. Compare
these two texts and notice where the old information (in italics) and new information (in bold)
is placed in the second sentence of each. The second text uses a passive:
- The three machines tested for the report contained different types of safety valve. The Boron
Group in Germany manufactured the machines.
- The three machines tested for the report contained different types of safety valve. The
machines were manufactured by the Boron Group in Germany.
- It is often more natural to put agents (subjects) which consist of long expressions at the end of
a sentence. Using the passive allows us to do this. So, for example:
- I was surprised by Don''s decision to give up his job and move to Sydney.
is more natural than ''Don''s decision to give up his job and move to Sydney surprised me.''', 4);

- People in the area have been told that they should stay indoors.
- Everyone was asked to bring some food to the party.
A common way of reporting what is said by people in general or by an unspecified group of
people is to use it + passive verb + that-clause (see Units 44 and 45 for more on that-clauses):
- It is reported that the finance minister is to resign.
- It has been acknowledged that underfunding is part of the problem.
- It can be seen that prices rose sharply in September.
Other verbs that can be used in this pattern include agree, allege, announce, assume, calculate,
claim, consider, decide, declare, discover, estimate, expect, feel, find, know, mention, propose,
recommend, say, show, suggest, suppose, think, understand.
Notice that many other verbs are not used in this pattern, including inform, persuade, reassure,
-remind, tell, warn.
With the verbs agree, decide, forbid, hope, plan, and propose, we can use it + passive verb + to infinitive
(notice that some of these are also used in the pattern it + passive verb + that-clause):
- It was agreed to postpone the meeting.
- It has been decided to build a road around the village.
В ^n a l t e r n a t : i v e t o it + passive verb + that-clause is to use subject + passive verb + to-infinitive:
- It was expected that the damage would be extensive, or
- The damage was expected to be extensive.
- It had been thought that the chemicals convey important information to the brain, or
- The chemicals had been thought to convey important information to the brain.
«Most of the verbs listed in the box in A can also be used in this pattern except for agree,
- announce, decide, mention, propose, recommend, suggest.
We can only use tell in this pattern when it means ''order''. So we can say:
- I was told (= ordered) to go with them to the railway station.
but not ''The accident was told (= said) to have happened just after midnight''.
When a that-clause begins that + there..., we can make a passive form there + passive verb + to
be. Compare:
- It is thought (that) there are too many obstacles to peace, or
- There are thought to be too many obstacles to peace.
- In 1981 it was reported (that) there were only two experts on the disease in the country, or
- In 1981 there were reported to be only two experts on the disease in the country.

We usually use which when we are asking about a fixed or limited number of things or people,

difference in meaning. Compare:

INSERT INTO RULE(id_rule, name, detail, pack) VALUES (27, 'Unit 27: Negative questions, echo questions, questions with that-clauses', 'We can sometimes use negative yes/no or wh-questions to make a suggestion, to persuade
someone, to criticise, or to show that we are surprised, etc.:
- Why don''t we go out for a meal? (a suggestion)
- Wouldn''t it be better to go tomorrow instead? (persuading someone)
- Can''t you play that trumpet somewhere else? (a criticism)
- Didn''t you tell them who you were? (showing surprise)
We usually make a negative yes/no or wh- (particularly why) question with an auxiliary
verb + -n''t before the subject:
- Doesn''t he want to come with us? - Haven''t you got anything better to do?
- Why can''t we go by bus?
- ''I''m not sure I like their new house.'' ''What don''t you like about it?''
We can also ask a negative question using a negative statement and a positive ''tag'' at the end:
- We don''t have to leave just yet, do we?
In more formal speech and writing, or when we want to give some special emphasis to the
negative (perhaps to show that we are angry, very surprised, or that we want particularly to
persuade someone), we can put not after the subject:
- Did she not realise that she had broken the window?
- Can they not remember anything about it? - Why did you not return the money?
If the question word is the subject, we put -n''t or not after the auxiliary verb:
- Who wouldn''t like to own an expensive sports car? {not Who not would like...?)
We sometimes use negative words other than not (or -n''t) such as never, no, nobody, nothing,
and nowhere:
- Why do you never help me with my homework? (or Why don''t you ever help...?)
- Have you no money left? (or Don''t you have any money left?)
- Have you nowhere to go? (or Haven''t you got anywhere to go?)
(''Haven''t you any...?'' and ''Haven''t you anywhere...?'' would be formal in the last two examples.]
Some negative questions anticipate that the answer will be or should be ''Yes'':
- ''Wasn''t Chris in Japan when the earthquake struck?'' ''Yes, he was.''
- ''Didn''t I see you in Paris last week?'' ''That''s right.''
Other negative questions anticipate that the answer will be or should be ''No'':
- ''What''s wrong? Don''t you eat fish?'' ''No, it disagrees with me.''
- ''Haven''t you finished yet?'' ''Sorry, not yet.''
It is usually clear from the context which kind of answer is anticipated.
Notice how we answer negative questions:
- ''Don''t you enjoy helping me?'' ''Yes.'' (= Yes, I do enjoy it.) or ''No.'' (= No, I don''t enjoy it.)
- ''You''re not living here, are you?'' ''Yes.'' (= Yes, I am living here.) or ''No.'' (= No, I''m not
living here.)
We can make a suggestion with Why not + verb or Why don''t/doesn''t...:
- Why not decorate the house yourself? (or Why don''t you decorate...?)
- Why not give her what she wants f (or Why don''t we give her...?)
Why didn''t... isn''t used to make a suggestion, but can be used to criticise someone:
- Why didn''t you tell me that in the first place?', 4);
