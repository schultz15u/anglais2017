INSERT INTO RULE(id_rule, name, detail, pack) VALUES (1, 'Unit 1: Present continuous and present simple 1', 
'We use the present simple to describe things that are always true, or situations that exist now and,
as far as we know, will go on indefinitely:
• It takes me five minutes to get to school.
• Trees grow more quickly in summer than in winter. • Liz plays the violin brilliantly.
To talk about particular actions or events that have begun but have not ended at the time of
speaking, we use the present continuous:
• The car isn''t starting again.
• ''Who are you phoning?'' ''I''m trying to get through to Joan.''
• The shop is so inefficient that many customers are taking their business elsewhere.
We often use time expressions such as at the moment, at present, currently, just, and still to
emphasise that the action or event is happening now:
• ''Have you done the shopping?'' Tm just going.''
Notice that the action or event may not be going on at the time of speaking:
• The police are talking to a number of people about the robbery.
We use the present simple to talk about habits or things that happen on a regular basis:
• I leave work at 5.30 most days.
• Each July we go to Turkey for a holiday.
However, when we describe repeated actions or events that are happening at or around the time
of speaking, we use the present continuous:
• Why are you jumping up and down?
• I''m hearing a lot of good reports about your work these days.
We can use the present continuous or the present simple to describe something that we regularly
do at a particular time. Compare:
• We usually watch the news on TV at 9.00. (= we start watching at 9.00)
• We''re usually watching the news on TV at 9.00. (= we''re already watching at 9.00)
We use the present continuous to imply that a situation is or may be temporary. Compare:
• Banks lend money to make a profit, (this is what usually happens)
• Banks are lending more money (these days) to encourage businesses to expand, (implies a
temporary arrangement)
• She teaches Maths in a school in Bonn, (a permanent arrangement)
• She''s teaching Maths in a school in Bonn, (implies that this is not, or may not be, permanent)
We often use the present simple with verbs that perform the action they describe:
• I admit I can''t see as well as I used to. (= an admission)
• I refuse to believe that he didn''t know the car was stolen. (= a refusal)
Other verbs like this (sometimes called performative verbs) include accept, acknowledge, advise,
apologise, assume, deny, guarantee, hope, inform, predict, promise, recommend, suggest,
suppose, warn.
We can use modals with performative verbs to make what we say more tentative or polite:.
• I would advise you to arrive two hours before the flight leaves.
• I''m afraid I have to inform you that your application for funding has been turned down.', 1);
