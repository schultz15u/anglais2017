'We use the present simple to describe things that are always true, or situations that exist now and,
as far as we know, will go on indefinitely:
- It takes me five minutes to get to school.
- Trees grow more quickly in summer than in winter. - Liz plays the violin brilliantly.
To talk about particular actions or events that have begun but have not ended at the time of
speaking, we use the present continuous:
- The car isn''t starting again.
- ''Who are you phoning?'' ''I''m trying to get through to Joan.''
- The shop is so inefficient that many customers are taking their business elsewhere.
We often use time expressions such as at the moment, at present, currently, just, and still to
emphasise that the action or event is happening now:
- ''Have you done the shopping?'' Tm just going.''
Notice that the action or event may not be going on at the time of speaking:
- The police are talking to a number of people about the robbery.
We use the present simple to talk about habits or things that happen on a regular basis:
- I leave work at 5.30 most days.
- Each July we go to Turkey for a holiday.
However, when we describe repeated actions or events that are happening at or around the time
of speaking, we use the present continuous:
- Why are you jumping up and down?
- I''m hearing a lot of good reports about your work these days.
We can use the present continuous or the present simple to describe something that we regularly
do at a particular time. Compare:
- We usually watch the news on TV at 9.00. (= we start watching at 9.00)
- We''re usually watching the news on TV at 9.00. (= we''re already watching at 9.00)
We use the present continuous to imply that a situation is or may be temporary. Compare:
- Banks lend money to make a profit, (this is what usually happens)
- Banks are lending more money (these days) to encourage businesses to expand, (implies a
temporary arrangement)
- She teaches Maths in a school in Bonn, (a permanent arrangement)
- She''s teaching Maths in a school in Bonn, (implies that this is not, or may not be, permanent)
We often use the present simple with verbs that perform the action they describe:
- I admit I can''t see as well as I used to. (= an admission)
- I refuse to believe that he didn''t know the car was stolen. (= a refusal)
Other verbs like this (sometimes called performative verbs) include accept, acknowledge, advise,
apologise, assume, deny, guarantee, hope, inform, predict, promise, recommend, suggest,
suppose, warn.
We can use modals with performative verbs to make what we say more tentative or polite:.
- I would advise you to arrive two hours before the flight leaves.
- I''m afraid I have to inform you that your application for funding has been turned down.', 22);

INSERT INTO RULE(id_rule, name, detail, pack) VALUES (131, 'Unit 31: Verb + -ing', 'Some verbs must have an object before an -ing form:
- The police found the man climbing the wall.
- She overheard them talking about the
closure of the factory.
Other verbs like this include catch, discover, feel, hear, leave, notice, observe, see, spot, watch

Notice, however, that this is not the case when these verbs are in the passive:
- The man was found climbing the wall.

Some verbs can have an object or no object before an -ing form:
- They can''t stand (him) driving his old car.
- I remember (you) buying that jumper.
Other verbs like this include detest, dislike, dread, envisage, hate, imagine, like, love, mind 
(in questions and negatives), miss, recall, regret, resent, risk, start, stop 

Some verbs can''t have an object before an -ing form:
- Despite his injury he continued playing.
- I actually enjoy cleaning shoes. It''s relaxing!
Other verbs like this include admit, advise, consider, delay, deny, deserve, escape, face,
finish, forget, propose, put off, suggest

Some of the verbs in ะ and ะก (admit, deny, forget, recall, regret, remember) can be followed by
having + past participle instead of the -ing form, with little difference in meaning:
- He remembered having arrived at the party, but not leaving, (or He remembered arriving...)
- I now regret having bought the car. (or I now regret buying...)
These pairs of sentences have the same meaning:
- I resented Tom winning the prize. 	and - I resented Tom''s winning the prize.
- Mary recalled him borrowing the book, and - Mary recalled his borrowing the book.
Other verbs that can be followed by an object with a possessive and then an -ing form include
verbs of ''(dis)liking'' such as detest, disapprove of, dislike, hate, like, love, object to, and verbs of
''thinking'' such as envisage, forget, imagine, remember, think of. Notice that we can only use a
possessive form (Tom''s, his) like this to talk about a person or a group of people:
- I remembered the horse winning the race, (but not ...the horse''s winning...)
The possessive form in this pattern is usually considered to be rather formal.
A few verbs (feel, hear, notice, observe, overhear, see, watch) can be followed either by an -ing
form or a bare infinitive, but the meaning may be slightly different:
an -ing form
	suggests that the action is repeated or happens over a period of time.
	 # Did you hear those dogs barking most of the night?
	suggests that we watch, etc. some of the action, but not from start to finish 
 I 	 was able to watch them building the new car park from my office window.
a bare infinitive
	suggests that the action happens only once 
	 I noticed him throw a sweet wrapper on the floor, so I asked him to pick it up.
	suggests that we watch, hear, etc. the whole action from its start to its finish
	 I watched him climb through the window, and then I called the police.'

INSERT INTO RULE(id_rule, name, detail, pack) VALUES (115, 'Unit 15: Can, could, be able to and be allowed to', 'When we say that someone or something has or doesn''t have the ability to do something, we can
use can(''t) (or cannot) (for the present) or could(n''t) (for the past):
- He can analyse people''s handwriting. - We can''t afford to pay the bill.
- Anita could speak three languages before she was six.
We can use be able to instead of can/could to talk about an ability that someone has or had:
- Helen can / is able to read well, even though she''s only three.
- He could / was able to draw on the support of over 20,000 troops.
In general, we use be able to when we talk about a specific achievement (particularly if it is
difficult, requiring some effort) rather than a general ability. Study this table:

			general ability								specific achievement
present 	We prefer can (but can also use be			We prefer be able to (but can also use can):
			able to):									- He has now recovered from his injury
			- He can speak Spanish.						and is able to drive again.

past		We prefer could (but can also use be		We use be able to (not could) :
			able to):									- Jenny was able to leave the hospital
			- After only six months, Suzanne			only six hours after the baby was born.
			could play the violin quite well.

However, we commonly use can or could, even when we are talking about specific occasions,
with verbs of the senses, feel, hear, see, smell, taste, and with verbs of ''thinking'', e.g. believe,
decide, remember, understand:
n - She could feel the spray on her face as the boat raced through the water.
- - I can''t decide where to go for my holidays.
We don''t use be able to
- when we talk about something that
is happening as we are speaking:
- before be + past participle:
- This furniture can be assembled by anyone, with just a screwdriver.
We use be able to, not can or could, if the idea we want to express needs a to-infinitive, an -ing
form, or a perfect tense, or if it follows another modal verb:
- We were very lucky to be able to live in the country during our childhood.
- It was awful, not being able to see you for so long.
- Since he left, none of the other team members have been able to match his enthusiasm.
- We may be able to move some of the staff to a different department.
We use will be able to, not can, to say that something will be possible in the future:
a - If the snow carries on like this, very few people will be able to get to the concert.
- - When the new road is built, I''ll be able to drive to work in under half an hour.
However, when we make a decision now about something in the future, we use can:
- You can go home when you''ve finished writing your composition.
- Perhaps we can meet next week.', 22);

INSERT INTO RULE(id_rule, name, detail, pack) VALUES (116, 'Unit 16: Will, would and used to', 'We can use will (for the present) and would (for the past) to talk about characteristic behaviour or
habits, or about things that are or were always true:
- Every day Dan will come home from work and turn on the TV.
- During the war, people would eat all kinds of things that we don''t eat now.
- A baby will recognise its mother''s voice soon after it is born.
- Early passenger planes wouldn''t hold more than 30 passengers.
We don''t use would in this way to talk about a particular occasion in the past. Compare:
- Each time I gave him a problem he would solve it for me. and
- Last night I gave him a problem and he solved it for me. {not ...he would solve it...)
In speech, we can stress will or would to criticise people''s characteristic behaviour or habits:
- She will leave all the lights on in the house when she goes out.
- I was happy when Sam left. He would talk about people behind their backs.
When we use stressed would in this way, we can also use it to talk about a particular occasion in
the past. We suggest that what happened was predictable because it was typical of a person''s
behaviour:
- ''Jackie says she can''t help because she''s got a lot of work on.'' ''Well she would say that - she
always uses that excuse.''
If we want to talk about things that happened repeatedly in the past, but don''t happen now, we
can use would or used to + infinitive. Used to is more common in informal English:
- We would / used to lend him money when he was unemployed.
- Tim would / used to visit his parents every other weekend.
We use used to but not would when we talk about past states that have changed:
n - The factory used to be in the city centre.
- - I used to smoke heavily when I was at university.
When we use would we need to mention a specific time or set of occasions. Compare:
- We used to play in the garden, {not We would play...)
- Whenever we went to my Uncle Frank''s house, we would / used to play in the garden.
We don''t use either used to or would when we say exactly how many times something
happened, how long something took, or that something happened at a particular time:
a - We visited Switzerland four times during the 1970s.
- - She went on holiday to the Bahamas last week.
Study how we normally make questions and negatives with used to in spoken English:
- Did your children use to sleep well when they were babies?
- I didn''t use to like visiting the dentist when I was young.
These forms are sometimes written as ''...did ... used to...'' and ''...didn''t used to...'', but some
people think this is incorrect.
However, in more formal spoken and written English the following negative and question forms
are also used, although this question form is now rare:
- There used not to be so much traffic, {more likely is There didn''t use to be...)
- Used you to go to university with the Evans brothers? {more likely is Did you use to...?)
Notice that nowadays very few people use used to in tags:
- He used to play cricket for Australia, didn''t he? {rather than ..., usedn''t he?)', 22);
