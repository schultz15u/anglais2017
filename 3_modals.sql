- He can analyse people''s handwriting. - We can''t afford to pay the bill.
- Anita could speak three languages before she was six.
We can use be able to instead of can/could to talk about an ability that someone has or had:
- Helen can / is able to read well, even though she''s only three.
- He could / was able to draw on the support of over 20,000 troops.
In general, we use be able to when we talk about a specific achievement (particularly if it is
difficult, requiring some effort) rather than a general ability. Study this table:

			general ability								specific achievement
present 	We prefer can (but can also use be			We prefer be able to (but can also use can):

However, we commonly use can or could, even when we are talking about specific occasions,
with verbs of the senses, feel, hear, see, smell, taste, and with verbs of ''thinking'', e.g. believe,
decide, remember, understand:
n - She could feel the spray on her face as the boat raced through the water.
- - I can''t decide where to go for my holidays.
We don''t use be able to
- when we talk about something that
is happening as we are speaking:
- before be + past participle:
- This furniture can be assembled by anyone, with just a screwdriver.
We use be able to, not can or could, if the idea we want to express needs a to-infinitive, an -ing
form, or a perfect tense, or if it follows another modal verb:
- We were very lucky to be able to live in the country during our childhood.
- It was awful, not being able to see you for so long.
- Since he left, none of the other team members have been able to match his enthusiasm.
- We may be able to move some of the staff to a different department.
We use will be able to, not can, to say that something will be possible in the future:
a - If the snow carries on like this, very few people will be able to get to the concert.
- - When the new road is built, I''ll be able to drive to work in under half an hour.

habits, or about things that are or were always true:
- Every day Dan will come home from work and turn on the TV.
- During the war, people would eat all kinds of things that we don''t eat now.
- A baby will recognise its mother''s voice soon after it is born.
- Early passenger planes wouldn''t hold more than 30 passengers.
We don''t use would in this way to talk about a particular occasion in the past. Compare:
- Each time I gave him a problem he would solve it for me. and
- Last night I gave him a problem and he solved it for me. {not ...he would solve it...)
In speech, we can stress will or would to criticise people''s characteristic behaviour or habits:
- She will leave all the lights on in the house when she goes out.
- I was happy when Sam left. He would talk about people behind their backs.
When we use stressed would in this way, we can also use it to talk about a particular occasion in
the past. We suggest that what happened was predictable because it was typical of a person''s
behaviour:
- ''Jackie says she can''t help because she''s got a lot of work on.'' ''Well she would say that - she
always uses that excuse.''
If we want to talk about things that happened repeatedly in the past, but don''t happen now, we
can use would or used to + infinitive. Used to is more common in informal English:
- We would / used to lend him money when he was unemployed.
- Tim would / used to visit his parents every other weekend.
We use used to but not would when we talk about past states that have changed:
n - The factory used to be in the city centre.
- - I used to smoke heavily when I was at university.
When we use would we need to mention a specific time or set of occasions. Compare:
- We used to play in the garden, {not We would play...)
- Whenever we went to my Uncle Frank''s house, we would / used to play in the garden.
We don''t use either used to or would when we say exactly how many times something
happened, how long something took, or that something happened at a particular time:
a - We visited Switzerland four times during the 1970s.
- - She went on holiday to the Bahamas last week.
Study how we normally make questions and negatives with used to in spoken English:
- Did your children use to sleep well when they were babies?
- I didn''t use to like visiting the dentist when I was young.
These forms are sometimes written as ''...did ... used to...'' and ''...didn''t used to...'', but some
people think this is incorrect.
However, in more formal spoken and written English the following negative and question forms
are also used, although this question form is now rare:
- There used not to be so much traffic, {more likely is There didn''t use to be...)
- Used you to go to university with the Evans brothers? {more likely is Did you use to...?)
Notice that nowadays very few people use used to in tags:
- He used to play cricket for Australia, didn''t he? {rather than ..., usedn''t he?)', 3);

might to say there is a possibility of something happening or being true:
- This may/might be his last major speech before the election.
- The news may/might come as a shock to many of the people present.
- When Frank gets a job, I may/might get the money back that I lent him.
There is often little difference in meaning, but might can suggest that there is less possibility.
We can also use could, but not can, to express a similar meaning. We prefer could to show that
we are giving an opinion about which we are unsure:
n - ''Why isn''t Tim here yet?'' ''It may/might/could be because his mother is ill again.''
- - There may/might/could be some cake left. I''ll go and look.
We can use can in affirmative sentences when we talk about a more general possibility of
something happening rather than the possibility of something happening in a particular
situation:
- The temperature can sometimes reach 35°C in July.
- Mountain daisies can be yellow or red.
- It may/might/could rain later, {not It can...)
We prefer may rather than can in more formal contexts:
- Exceeding the stated dose may cause drowsiness, (from a medicine container)
We don''t use may to ask questions about the possibility of something happening. Instead we
use, for example, could(n''t) or the phrase be likely:
a - Could it be that you don''t want to leave?
- - Are you likely to be visiting Greece again this summer?
It is possible to use might in this type of question, but it is rather formal:
- Might they be persuaded to change their minds?
In negative sentences, including sentences with words like only, hardly or never, to say that
something is not the case we can use can''t (or more formally cannot) or couldn''t (or could not):
- There can''t/couldn''t be any milk left - 1 would have seen it in the fridge.
- There can/could hardly be any doubt that he was guilty.
Compare the use of may/might and can/could in negative sentences:
- There are plans to rebuild the town centre, but it may not / might not happen for another
ten years. (= It is possible that it won''t happen for another ten years.)
- There are plans to rebuild the town centre, but it can''t/couldn''t happen for another ten
years. (= It is not possible that it will happen for another ten years.)
The difference is that we use may not or might not to say that it is possible that something is not
true, and can''t or couldn''t to say that it is not possible that something is true.
We use may well, might well or could well to say it is likely that something will happen:
- The profits of the company may/might/could well reach $100 million this year.
We don''t use can well in this way to talk about the future. However, can well is used to talk
about something we think or feel now:
- I can well recall how I felt when John told us he was moving to South Africa.
Other words commonly used after may, might, could and can to say it is possible that something
will happen are conceivably and possibly:
- The President may conceivably call an election in June. (= it is possible to believe it)
- The new parking restrictions could possibly lead to fewer cars in our cities.', 3);

- To get a cheap ticket, you must / have (got) to book in advance.
- Every animal on the island must / has (got) to be destroyed.
When we want to say that it will be necessary for someone to do something in the future, we use
must, have (got) to, or will have to:
- To get there on time, I must / have (got) to / will have to leave home by 8.30.
Have got to is less formal than the others, and is particularly common in spoken English. We can
often use need (to) with a similar meaning:
- Before you buy a house, you need to / must / have (got) to consider all the costs.
(For mustn''t and haven''t got to / don''t have to, see Unit 24.)
D Using have (got) to suggests that someone else or some outside circumstances or authority makes
something necessary.We use must when the speaker decides it is necessary. Compare:
- I have to see the head teacher, (...she has called me to her office)
- I must see the head teacher. (...I want to discuss something with her)
We prefer have (got) to when we talk about a necessity that is characteristic of a person:
- Ann has got to have at least eight hours'' sleep a night.
- She has to drink two cups of coffee in the morning before she feels really awake.
О We normally use must, not have (got) to, when we CONCLUDE that something (has) happened or
that something is true (see also Unit 17D):
- With that pile of papers on his desk, Tony must be wishing he''d never taken the job.
- The hall''s packed. There must be about 2,000 people at the meeting.
However, in informal speech, we can use have (got) to:
- Look at all those penguins. There''s got to be about a million of them!
- You want to borrow more money from me? You''ve got to be joking!
When we give a negative conclusion we rarely use either must not or hasn''t / haven''t got to.
Instead, we use can''t (cannot) or couldn''t:
- ''I''m seeing Dr Evans next week.'' ''That can''t be right. He''s on holiday then.''
- He wasn''t there at the time. It couldn''t have been his fault.
Must has no other forms than the present tense (no past tense, no participles, etc.) and in past
tense sentences which say that it was necessary to do something, we use had to instead:
- Bill''s not here. He had to leave early. - The car broke down and we had to get a taxi.
To draw a conclusion about something in the past, we use must + have + past participle:
- You must have been upset when you heard the news.
- She must have played really well to win. I wish I''d seen the match.
Sometimes we can use either have to or have got to. However, we prefer have to with frequency
adverbs such as always, never, normally, rarely, sometimes, etc.:
- I often have to work at the weekend to get everything done.
With the past simple, we use had to, especially in questions and negative sentences:
- When did you have to give the books back? {not When had you got to...)
- We didn''t have to wait too long for an answer, (not We hadn''t got to...)
After contracted forms of have, has or had (e.g. I''ve, He''s, It''d) we use got:

have to to say that something is NOT NECESSARY:
- You mustn''t walk on the grass here.
- You mustn''t put anything on the shelves until the glue has set hard.
- They proved that watching a chess match needn''t be boring.
- We needn''t go into details now, but we seem to agree on the general principles.
D Need, needn''t, and don''t need to / don''t have to
Need can be used as a modal verb (before a bare infinitive) or as an ordinary verb. Compare:
a - You needn''t speak so loudly. (= modal verb)
- - She needn''t come with us if she doesn''t want to. (= modal verb)
- She''s thirsty. She needs a drink. (= ordinary verb)
- Jim and Bob are here. They say they need to see you urgently. (= ordinary verb)
When it is a modal verb need is most commonly used in negative sentences, although it is
sometimes also used in questions:
- Need you go home so soon? (or, more commonly Do you have to go...?)
- Need I say more? (or, more commonly Do I have to say...?)
We can use either needn''t or don''t have to when we say that is unnecessary to do something:
- It would be good to see you, but you needn''t ((or don''t have to) come if you''re busy.
- You needn''t (or don''t have to) whisper. Nobody can hear us.
Compare these uses of needn''t and don''t need to.

To give permission not to do something we can use either needn''t or don''t need to:
- You needn''t cut the grass, I''ll do it later. /
- You don''t need to cut the grass, I''ll do it later. /

To talk about a general necessity, we prefer don''t need to:
You don''t need to be over 18 to get into a disco. /
You needn''t be over 18 to get into a disco. X

Didn''t need to / didn''t have to and need not have
When we say that it was not necessary to do something in the past, and it wasn''t done, we use
didn''t need to or didn''t have to. To show that we think something that was done was not, in
fact, necessary we use need not have:
- Chris and June phoned to say that they couldn''t come to eat, so I didn''t need/have to cook
dinner. (= I didn''t cook the dinner)
- I needn''t have cooked dinner. Just as it was ready, Chris and June phoned to say that they
couldn''t come to eat. (= I did cook the dinner)
Study how we use need with scarcely, hardly, and only, particularly in formal contexts:
- We need hardly point out that there is a water shortage at the moment. (= it is almost
unnecessary for us to point out...)
- I need scarcely add that you will be missed. (= it is almost unnecessary for me to add...)
- The changes need only be small to make the proposals acceptable.
''...hardly need to point out...,'' ''...scarcely need to add...'' and ''...only need to be...'' are also
possible, and less formal.', 3);

OBLIGATION a n d PROBABILITY.
Obligation
- giving ADVICE or making a RECOMMENDATION:
- ''This soup is too salty!'' ''You should / ought to send it back.''
- You''ll catch cold if you go out like that. I think you should / ought to take a hat.
or saying what an outside authority recommends (although we prefer should in this case):
- The manual says that the computer should be disconnected (= passive) from the mains
before the cover is removed, (rather than ...ought to be disconnected...)
However, we use should (or would), not ought to, when we give advice with I:
- I should leave early tomorrow, if I were you. (or I would leave..., or I''d leave...)
- talking about a RESPONSIBILITY or DUTY:
- People should / ought to be warned (= passive) of the danger of swimming off this beach.
- I should / ought to visit my parents more often.
Probability
- saying that something is PROBABLY TRUE now or will probably be true in the future:
- ''Have we got any string?'' ''There should / ought to be some in the kitchen drawer.''
(because that''s where we always keep it)
- You should / ought to have received the report by now.
- I enjoyed her first novel, so the new one should / ought to be good.
We use should / ought to + have + past participle to talk about an obligation in the past. We often
indicate some criticism or regret:
- He should / ought to have asked me before he took my bike. (I''m annoyed)
- We should / ought to have taken a taxi when it rained. (I''m sorry we didn''t)
We also use should / ought to + have + past participle to talk about an expectation that something
happened, has happened, or will happen:
- If the flight was on time, he should / ought to have arrived in Jakarta early this morning.
- The builders should / ought to have finished by the end of the week.
We can use had better instead of should / ought to, especially in spoken English, to say that we
think it would be sensible or advisable to do something. However, we don''t use it to talk about
the past or to make general comments:
- If you''re not well, you should / ought to ask Ann to go instead, (or ...you''d better ask...)
- You should / ought to have caught a later train, (not You had better have...)
- I don''t think parents should / ought to give their children sweets, (not ...had better...)
When we make a logical conclusion from some situation or activity, we use must not should or
ought to (for more on must, see Unit 23):
a - You must be mad if you think I''m going to lend you any more money.
- - It''s the third time she''s been skating this week - she must really enjoy it.
We can use (be) supposed to instead of should / ought to to talk about an obligation to do
something. It is commonly used in spoken English to express a'' less strong obligation:
- I''m supposed to be there at 10.00. - The work was supposed to start last week.
We use (be) supposed to when we report what many people think is true:
- Eating sweets is supposed to be bad for your teeth, (not ...should be bad for...)', 3);
